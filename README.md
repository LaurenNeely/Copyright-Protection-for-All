# Introduction
Music CAN change the world! PeaceTones enables musicians to develop and disseminate their art by brining crucial legal, technology, and business skills to historically unheard musicians. This empowers them as leaders and shapers of positive social change.
 
eJust and RelateID have joined forces with PeaceTones to address the question, “who owns created music?”. Join us as we combine eJust’s highly efficient dispute resolution framework and RelateID’s innovative identity verification, asset association, and storage protocols to address this crucial question.

We NEED your help – and so do people like Emmanual, the Liberian refugee at the heart of the dispute we will resolve.
 
Music CAN change the world – and YOU can help. Join us Saturday at the [2018 Computational Law and Blockchain Festival](https://legalhackers.org/clbfest2018/). Follow the links below to find out more.

We look forward to working with you!

# Background

[PeaceTones](https://peacetones.org) enables musicians to develop and disseminate their art by brining crucial legal, technology, and business skills to historically unheard musicians. Historically, in a developing country, refugee camp, or anywhere in the world (really) to initiate the music creation process, a producer relies on intermediaries for introductions and connections to identify musicians and verify the identity of the artists and origination of their work. The secure, scalable trust-based RelateID blockchain simplifies and digitally enhances this process.

# RelateID

[RelateID](http://relateid.com/) is a secure, scalable trust-based personal data blockchain for the world. It returns power over identity and assets associated with that identity to the individual and gives him/her control over who accesses what private information, and for how long. The RelateID Identity Verification process is outlined in the attached Flow Diagram.

In addition to individual identities, complex immutable non-fungible transferable assets can be created, shared, and transferred on the RelateID network. This includes many forms of digital intellectual property, such as musical releases, art, technical papers, or literature, which can be created and managed by individuals or entities. Files can be stored on the distributed global file system known as Inter Planetary File System (IPFS), and a unique asset can be created to track purchase and ownership of every copy of that asset (who has purchased what song and for how long, for example). The location of the asset in IPFS can be encrypted into the asset token and transferred to anyone on the network. The location can only be acquired by the owner of the token, and each time the token is transferred, the location of the file on the IPFS – known as the hash of the file – can be changed, and the old hash removed to ensure that no one is able to access the files without permission. Any copies will be revealed as copies and not the original, based on the original time and date of creation of the original file.

With the RelateID identity and asset verification processes, the PeaceTones artist is securely, legally, and immutably linked to his or her music.
